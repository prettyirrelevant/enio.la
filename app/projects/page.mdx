# Projects

Some things I've built over the years.

## [<Neuron/>](https://github.com/prettyirrelevant/final-year-project 'Neuron')

My undergraduate final year project: a student attendance system using Bluetooth Low Energy with an ESP32 microcontroller. The system includes a mobile app, an authentication server, and an IoT component that handles the Bluetooth communication.

## [<WrappedNaira/>](https://github.com/prettyirrelevant/wrapped-naira 'Wrapped Naira')

A proof-of-concept fiat-to-crypto ramp that lets users convert Naira into a stablecoin ERC-20 token. It features a P2P exchange mechanism for seamless on/off-ramping between fiat and crypto.

## [<Gistrunner/>](https://github.com/prettyirrelevant/gistrunner 'Gistrunner')

A sandbox environment for executing code snippets directly from GitHub Gists, with support for multiple languages and isolated execution environments.

## [<Bridgebloc/>](https://github.com/prettyirrelevant/bridgebloc 'Bridgebloc')

A token bridge for transferring assets across EVM-compatible chains. Built during a hackathon to explore cross-chain interoperability patterns.

## [<Decodify/>](https://github.com/prettyirrelevant/decodify 'Decodify')

A browser extension that decodes Etherscan transactions into a human-readable format using Rotki's transaction decoder, making it easier to understand what on-chain transactions actually do.

## [<Waakye/>](https://github.com/prettyirrelevant/waakye 'Waakye')

A playlist converter that moves your music between Spotify, YouTube Music, and Deezer, handling track matching across platforms and preserving playlist metadata.
